## Requirements
This package requires PHP 5.6 or higher.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
$ composer require argentcrusade/flysystem-selectel
```

## Upgrade

### From 1.0* to 1.1.0
New setting `container_url` was added. You can set your container's custom domain here (for example, `https://static.example.org`) and this option will be used when retrieving fully qualified URLs to files and directories.

## Usage

``` php
use ArgentCrusade\Flysystem\Selectel\SelectelAdapter;
use ArgentCrusade\Selectel\CloudStorage\Api\ApiClient;
use ArgentCrusade\Selectel\CloudStorage\CloudStorage;
use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;

$api = new ApiClient('selectel-username', 'selectel-password');
$storage = new CloudStorage($api);
$container = $storage->getContainer('container-name');

$adapter = new SelectelAdapter($container);
$filesystem = new Filesystem($adapter);
```

## Laravel Integration

You can use this adapter with Laravel's [Storage System](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/filesystem).

If you're running Laravel 5.5+ this package will auto-added to your providers list via auto-discovery feature (requires version 1.2+ of this package).

### Laravel <= 5.4
Add `ArgentCrusade\Flysystem\Selectel\SelectelServiceProvider::class` to your providers list in `config/app.php`

```php
/*
 * Package Service Providers...
 */
ArgentCrusade\Flysystem\Selectel\SelectelServiceProvider::class,
```

### All Laravel versions
Add `selectel` disk to `config/filesystems.php` configuration file (`disks` section):

```php
'selectel' => [
    'driver' => 'selectel',
    'username' => 'selectel-username',
    'password' => 'selectel-password',
    'container' => 'selectel-container',
    'container_url' => 'https://static.example.org',
]
```

`container_url` setting (new in version **1.1.0**) allows you to override default Selectel's CDN domain (if you have custom domain attached). You may omit this setting if you're using default domain, file URLs will look like `http://XXX.selcdn.ru/container_name/path/to/file.txt`, where `XXX` - your unique subdomain (`X-Storage-Url` header value).

Now you can use Selectel disk as

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;

Storage::disk('selectel')->put('file.txt', 'Hello world');
```

Also you may want to set `selectel` as default disk to ommit `disk('selectel')` calls and use storage just as `Storage::put('file.txt', 'Hello world')`.

For more info please refer to Laravel's [Storage System](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/filesystem) documentation.

## Unsupported methods
Due to the implementation of the Selectel API some methods are missing or may not function as expected.

### Visibility management
Selectel provides visibility support only for Containers, but not for files. The change of visibility for the entire container instead of a single file/directory may be confusing for adapter users. Adapter will throw `LogicException` on `getVisibility`/`setVisbility` calls.

### Directories management
Currently Selectel Adapter can display and delete only those directories that were created via `createDir` method. Dynamic directories (those that were created via `write`/`writeStream` methods) can not be deleted or listed as directory.

```php
$fs = new Filesystem($adapter);

$fs->createDir('images'); // The 'images' directory can be deleted and will be listed as 'dir' in the results of `$fs->listContents()`.

$fs->write('documents/hello.txt'); // The 'documents' directory can not be deleted and won't be listed in the results of `$fs->listContents()`.
```

## Note on Closing Streams
Selectel Adapter leaves the streams **open** after consuming them. Make sure that you've closed all streams that you opened.
